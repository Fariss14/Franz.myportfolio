Each location told a different story of who we are: Intramuros with its colonial legacy, Fort Santiago with its heroic struggles, Luneta with its national reverence, and MOA with its modern comforts. I walked away with a deeper appreciation for our history and a stronger connection to our culture. Seeing the places where our national heroes lived, walked, and gave their lives was emotional and humbling. It reminded me that our freedom was not given freely—it was earned through blood and sacrifice.

Cruising at altitude, we gazed out the window at a sky sprinkled with stars, the gentle hum of the cabin lulling us into a reflective mood.

Our guide, Kuya Enan, narrated each section with passion and detail, painting vivid pictures of how Filipino revolutionaries, especially Dr. Jose Rizal, were imprisoned here. We walked along the Rizal Last Walk path, retracing the final steps Rizal took before his execution in 1896. Inside the dungeon, the dim lighting and narrow cells evoked a haunting atmosphere that made the suffering of prisoners more tangible.

We learned how the MMDA uses a combination of CCTV cameras, sensors, and traffic lights that adapt to the flow of traffic to manage the city's roadways. One of the most impressive aspects was the use of an offline CCTV system, which remains functional even when internet connectivity is disrupted. This redundancy ensures that traffic monitoring is never interrupted, no matter the circumstances. Although we were also reminded of the emotional toll this job can take, as employees occasionally witness traumatic road incidents, it was clear that the MMDA plays an essential role in maintaining order and safety on Metro Manila's chaotic streets.
